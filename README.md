# Bounty Core

Bounty Core owns canonical storage, ledgers, and generated report navigation for Ghost bug bounty workflows.

## Canonical Storage

Storage is organized by program, family, and lane:

```text
~/Shared/{family}/{program}/{lane}/
```

Current canonical families are:

- `web_bounty`: web and API work, with default lanes `web` and `api`.
- `binaries`: binary and client work, with default lanes `apk`, `exe`, and `mac`.

Each lane keeps its own `reports/`, `ledgers/`, `working/`, `context/`, `notes/`, and `recon/` roots. Binary lanes also have `input/`. This keeps findings, generated artifacts, notes, and context isolated per target lane.

## Report UX

Current report UX centers on this reports tree:

```text
reports/
  findings/
  daily/
  categories/
  severity/
```

- `reports/{FID}/` is the immutable per-finding packet. It always contains the editable canonical `REPORT.md`; Bounty Core creates `poc/`, `evidence/`, and `_meta/` for agent artifacts. The optional `FINALIZED.md` is an explicit submission-ready copy made only by `finalize_finding_report`.
- Lifecycle and severity are generated navigation views, not storage paths. `report_dir` and `report_path` remain valid when status, severity, or title changes.
- `reports/daily/{MM-DD-YYYY}/` contains date-scoped views for active, confirmed, dormant, novel, and completed findings.
- `reports/categories/{category}/` contains category indexes and per-FID links or stubs back to canonical finding reports.
- `reports/severity/{high,medium,low}/` contains severity-focused indexes.

Compatibility indexes may still be written elsewhere, but this tree is the current report UX.

Generated navigation files are marked with:

```text
<!-- generated: bounty-core-report-navigation -->
```

Files with that marker are safe to refresh. Unmarked hand-authored navigation files are not overwritten. Generated finding reports are separately marked and checksummed; if a canonical finding report has been hand-edited, Bounty Core preserves it instead of replacing it during refresh.

## Navigation Dedupe

Generated navigation dedupes duplicate finding concepts by normalized title, file, line, and category. Duplicate FIDs are kept as aliases on the selected representative.

When choosing a representative for a duplicate concept, Bounty Core prefers lifecycle in this order:

```text
confirmed > active > dormant > completed
```

It then chooses by severity priority and finally by natural FID order.

Generated navigation uses Obsidian wikilinks for internal report links. Canonical finding links target the packet's stable `REPORT.md`, such as `[[REPORT|D54]]`; they do not depend on lifecycle, severity, title, or absolute path prefixes.
